00 - intro
==

in this course we will follow a practical approach to learn to code (the art of programming),
some things will be repeated time after time, while other things will be barely mentioned


01 - identity problems
==

the first thing to cover is the mentality of a novice coder

what is the best mentality in my opinion? you are ought to read "just on time", searching for solutions, explanations and examples when trying to get something done.
then, we gotta start with a goal, a problem to solve, etc. never reading theory just for the sake of it, at least not until you have reached a level advanced enough, where abstract theory makes sense on its own.
and that is exactly how most books are structured, by showing theorical concepts, explanations and the application of it, then you are giving some exercise.

02 - right into a task
==

"what? but i don't know anything..." u might be thinking
and that is precisely how it should be, u should have a goal in mind, a task to solve, and basically be searching on all those books, manuals, blogs, etc. "how i do X?", in a sense a programmer has to be a constant learner.
